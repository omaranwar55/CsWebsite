<hr color="#e6e6fa" /> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="place1">C</a>omputer science or data science is a science that studies the computing and data processing, theories and applications that form the basis for automating the transfer of information, operation and converted, by examining computer software and computer hardware in a scientific manner just.<br /> In some Arab countries called on the term Computer Science Informatics Acronym and not with a view to mixing it with other sciences. <br /><br />

Interested in computer science beginning to study the theoretical foundations of computing, data and applications in computer systems. <br />
Computer Science diverse fields are all classified under the broad heading of "computer science." Some stresses and some computing applications such as computer graphics, while the other branches studying the properties of a problem Thsepeh computational problem (such as computational complexity theory), while other branches remain focused on the challenges posed by computing applications. For example, the theory of programming language (programming language theory) is considering ways and means to describe process, while the computer programming applies specific programming languages ​​to extract the answer or solution to a certain Thsepeh problem.</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<HR COLOR="#e6e6fa">
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="place2">C</a>omputer Science dates back to the invention of the first modern digital computer. <br />
Before the twenties of the twentieth century, the term computer computer refers to any tool in the process of human calculations. 
<br />What are the issues or the things that the machine can calculate it by following a list of instructions with a pen and paper, without specifying the necessary time and without any skills or insight (smarter)?<br />
 He was one of the motives of these studies is to develop computing machines calculating machines can complete routine work and prone to human 
 error when making calculations mankind. <br /><br />

During the forties, with the development of more powerful calculating machines and computational capacity, <br />
develop a computer term that refers to machines instead of people doing the accounts. It became clear that computers could do more than just arithmetic operations and thus moved to study Thsab or computing machines in general. <br />
Began Informatics and Computer Science take a separate independence as an academic discipline in the sixties, with the creation of the early computer science departments in universities and universities began giving holidays in this science...

<h3>The most Imprtant Branches</h3>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="place3">T</a>he information can be divided into three sections:
<ol>
<li> <font>Information theory: taught moot languages​​, theories or computing algorithms and calculate costs</font></li>
<li><font>IT process: studying language translation skills moot, theories and algorithms to facilitate the circulation of applications, and its continuous development with What Amashi science and other areas of life</font></li>
<li><font>Applied Informatics: and take care of various computer applications in the areas of life: such as design and CNC, and administrative systems and industrial products</font></li>
<li><font> Computer Engineering: This section is concerned with how the computer equipment industry (computer hardware). Computer industry depends on many fields such as information theory, physics, chemistry, electronics</font><li>
</ol>
<p>The information also can be divided as follows:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><font>Science algorithms and theoretical data: She teaches the theoretical side of science data</font></li>
<li><font>Aware of computational techniques: the analysis, design and construction of the solid components of computers</font></li>
